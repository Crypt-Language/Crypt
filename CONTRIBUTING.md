# Contributing the Crypt Programming Language

Hi There! If you are reading this, then you wish to contribute to Crypt. 

First of all, thank you for taking an interest in the development of Crypt. It is you (the community) who become the driving force for the development of Open-Source projects(including Crypt)

Currently, The compiler of Crypt is in the **Indev** stage. If you still wish to contribute, then try to tackle the existing issues or chat in the community chat room to inform that you are working on a fix/feature.

[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Crypt-Language/community.svg)](https://gitter.im/Crypt-Language/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

More info on Contributions to Crypt will be given here after the compiler reaches the **Alpha** stage.

*Happy Coding!*
