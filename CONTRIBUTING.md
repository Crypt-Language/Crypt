# Contributing the Crypt Programming Language

Hi There! If you are reading this, then you wish to contribute to Crypt. 

First of all, thank you for taking an interest in the development of Crypt. It is you (the community) who is the driving force for the development of Open-Source projects (including Crypt).

Currently, The compiler of Crypt is in the **Indev** stage. This means there isn't much to do as the compiler is still largely incomplete/experimental.
But, the Interpreter, is largely complete, so any contributions to it are welcome!

## Ways to contribute
 - Star the repo : Starring the repo shows that you have interst in this project and wish to see it complete, This is a great contribution in itself as it provides me motivation to complete this project...

 - Pull up an Issue and make a PR : Pulling up an existing issues of the Crypt Interpreter/Compiler and try to solve them. Once you have done so, you can open a Pull Request addressing the issue. After I have reviewed the code and all is in green, congrats! You're officially a Crypt source developer!

 - Open a new issue : If there is no issue opened for the issue you have spotted, feel free to open one! I'll get started right away.

Once again, thank you for taking an interest in Crypt's development.

*Happy Coding!*
