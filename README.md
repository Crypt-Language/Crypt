Welcome to the home of the Crypt Programming language!

## Goal
Crypt aims to be a powerful, yet easy to learn/use  programming language leveraging Java's libraries and cross-platform ability by running on the JVM.

## Phase
**In Development** : A new compiler is being actively developed, with updates being released every week.

_I Recommend not downloading source code as the compiler is incomplete is subject to many changes._
