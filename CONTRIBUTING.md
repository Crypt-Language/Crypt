# Contributing the Crypt Programming Language

Hi There! If you are reading this, then you wish to contribute to Crypt. 

First of all, thank you for taking an interest in the development of Crypt. It is you (the community) who is the driving force for the development of Open-Source projects (including Crypt).

Currently, The compiler of Crypt is in the **Indev** stage. This means there isn't much to do as the compiler is still largely incomplete/experimental.

Contributions to Crypt will be accepted once the compiler reaches the **Alpha** stage. Until then, feel free to watch this repo for any updates or give it a star ðŸŒŸ if this repo deserves it.

Once again, thank you for taking an interest in Crypt's development.

*Happy Coding!*
